Spectrum Waterfall for rtl-sdr written in Java

To get samples you need a RTL2832U and rtl-sdr from http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr

Then simply plug in your RTL2832U and start rtl_tcp.  You can then click the start button and see / tune the spectrum.

This is a small tool I wrote because I wanted a java interface into the rtl-sdr and a lightweight way to view the spectrum.  I wrote the tool in Netbeans and the repo is a Netbeans project.
